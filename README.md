# Autonomous-Self-Navigating-Robot
Autonomous Self-Navigating Robot -- MEng Final Year Project

### Preface
This project, Autonomous Self-navigating Robot, is aimed at planning, designing and developing a robot that is able to help navigate itself around any environment avoiding any obstacles in the way. With the aid of several ultrasonic sensors that are used to detect objects in close proximity, the data received from the sensors will be analysed by a microcontroller that will then interpret the data and take a decision based on the outcome of the information received from the sensors. The outcome of the microcontroller is then observed in the form of physical movement in the robot body by the powering of four DC motors accordingly. 

Three navigation algorithms have been investigated and implemented for testing and development from selected papers. These are Binary Movement Algorithm, Wall-Follow Algorithm and Fixed Rotations Algorithm. Each of these methodologies have been tested and analysed for their advantages and drawbacks where they lacked satisfactory performance. A fourth algorithm has therefore been developed as a personal contribution which provides a combination of all previous algorithms. Variable Automated Rotations Algorithm aims and combining the positives of the previously three mentioned concepts while eliminating their drawbacks to allow for the best performance possible fit for this project.

In addition to the autonomous feature, the robot has been developed to allow external communication with nearby devices/users. This will allow for a remote manual control of the robot overriding the autonomous feature in case there is ever a need to override the microcontroller with manual control. Moreover, the robot has been programmed to self-test for faulty connections using a hardware testing algorithm. This allows the user to identify any loose or misconnected wires that might impact the performance of the robot.
